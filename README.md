### Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

I am Angel. Currently a Master's Student in Computer Science/Data Science and incoming Data Science Intern. My areas of interest are Unsupervised-Supervised ensemble models, Reduced-Order Modeling, and Data Mining. I have experience in both Python and R building unsupervised/supervised learning models, performing data analyses, and research development. 


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a few projects:
   - [The Past Decade in Music](https://github.com/angel-sarmiento/the_past_decade_in_music). A series of analyses, models, and shiny dashboards exploring the past decade in popular music using the Billboard Top 100 list, The Spotify API, and the Genius API. 
   - [ROM Projects](https://github.com/angel-sarmiento/POD-Projects). Performing **Proper Orthogonal Decomposition** and other model-order reduction techniques on physics-based simulations derived from PDEs. 
   - [Music Database Project](https://github.com/angel-sarmiento/music-database-project). A series of databases used in conjunction to solve the problem of managing different types of data for proper means of consumption. Includes Dynamodb, MongoDB, Apache Cassandra, and the Spotify and Genius API. 
   
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about Topic Modeling, Model-Order Reduction, and new database technologies while refining my Data Science fundamentals and programming skills.

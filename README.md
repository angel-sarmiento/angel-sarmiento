### Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

I am Angel. Currently a Master's Student in Computer Science/Data Science and incoming Data Science Intern. My areas of interest are Unsupervised-Supervised ensemble models, Reduced-Order Modeling, and Time Series Forecasting/Predictive Modeling. I have experience in both Python and R building unsupervised/supervised learning models, performing data analyses, and research development. 


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a few projects:
   - [The Past Decade in Music](https://github.com/angel-sarmiento/the_past_decade_in_music). A series of analyses, models, and shiny dashboards exploring the past decade in popular music using the Billboard Top 100 list, The Spotify API, and the Genius API. 
   - [Applied Deep Learning](https://github.com/angel-sarmiento/applied-deep-learning). A variety of mini-projects implementing Neural Networks from FCNs, CNNs, AEs/GANS, RNNs, etc. Based on a course I am taking in my Master's Program
   - [Yahoo Finance Ticker Dashboard](https://github.com/angel-sarmiento/stock-dashboard). A Streamlit dashboard implementing plots to get info-at-a-glance on an inputted stock ticker. The dashboard also implements multiple autoregressive/time series forecasting models with selectable tickers for stocks. (DAR, ARIMA, SARIMAX, etc.). Data pulled from the Yahoo Finance API.

   
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about Autoencoders, Streamlit Dashboard Development, and Data Warehousing methods and technologies while refining my Data Science fundamentals and programming skills.
